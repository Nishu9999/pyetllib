# Getting started

--- 

First, you may want to install `pyetllib`. This is super easy 
using `pip`.
``` bash
$ pip install pyetllib
``` 

Now, depending on what you plan to do, you may want to know more about 
the two main tools that come with `pyetllib`: `pyetl`and `etlskel`.

## Launcher program `pyetl` 

`pyetl` is both a launcher and an administration tool for ETL scripts. 
Read more about how to [run an ETL script](running.md)

## Project creator `etlskel`

`etlskel` lets you create the project structure of a new ETL script to 
be implemented. Read more about how 
to [create an ETL script](creating.md)

# Getting help

Both utilities implement a CLI using `Click` so help 
is always available.

``` bash
$ pyetl --help
$ etlskel --help
```
